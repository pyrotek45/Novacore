# Novacore

Novacore is a work-in-progress functional programming language designed for simplicity and ease of use. It is based on the idea that functions should be treated as first-class citizens, which means they can be passed around as values, returned as results, and composed together to form more complex functions.

One of the key features of Novacore is its unique syntax, which allows for both postfix and infix styles of programming. This means that you can write code in a way that makes the most sense to you and your problem domain.

While Novacore is still a work in progress and many things still need to be worked on, it already provides a number of built-in functions for common tasks such as filtering, mapping, and folding for lists. Novacore also supports blocks as data, which means that blocks of code can be treated as values and passed around as arguments to functions.

Novacore is designed to make programming fun and experimenting with code easy. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Novacore can help you explore the world of functional programming and have fun doing it. So why not give it a try and see what you can create?
